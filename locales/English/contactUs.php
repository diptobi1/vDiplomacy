        <h4>What to send</h4>
        <p>Always try to have some clear reasons when contacting and do not mention it on the forum. In your report you should include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If making a game request (e.g for a pause or unpause):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Please provide a link to your game or the game name (spelled correctly!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Please explain why you need a pause, how long you need it for, and the urgency. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                If reporting a cheater:
                <ul>
                <li>
                    Links to the accounts of the players who you suspect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Link(s) to any specific game(s) that raised your suspicions.
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will try to reply to you quickly, but be patient: investigations can take quite some time. If a week has gone by please feel free to follow up.</p>
