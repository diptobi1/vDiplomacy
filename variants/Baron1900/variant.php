                /* Suez_Canal_Rule
		 * (1) A fleet may move back and forth between Egypt and Hejaz. 
                 *      (no changes needed)
		 * (2) Movement between Egypt or Hejaz and the Mid-Atlantic 
                 *      Ocean is allowed. It is assumed the unit travels around 
                 *      the southern tip of Africa. A unit that moves in this 
                 *      manner does so at half strength. This means that a unit 
                 *      adjacent Egypt or Hejaz succeeds in moving there if 
                 *      opposed only by a fleet moving from the Mid-Atlantic 
                 *      Ocean and a fleet adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean 
                 *      succeeds in moving there if opposed only by a fleet 
                 *      moving from Egypt or Hejaz.
		 * (3) A fleet in Egypt or Hejaz cannot support a unit holding 
                 *      in or moving to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. This is true 
                 *      even though the fleet in Egypt or Hejaz can itself move 
                 *      to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. Likewise, a fleet in the 
                 *      Mid-Atlantic Ocean cannot support a unit holding in or 
                 *      moving to Egypt or Hejaz.
		 * (4) A fleet moving from Egypt or Hejaz to the Mid-Atlantic 
                 *      Ocean does not cut support being provided by a fleet 
                 *      already in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean unless the attack 
                 *      results in F Mid-Atlantic Ocean being dislodged. The 
                 *      opposite is equally true. A fleet moving from the 
                 *      Mid-Atlantic Ocean to Egypt or Hejaz does not cut 
                 *      support being provided by a unit already in Egypt or 
                 *      Hejaz unless the attack results in the unit being 
                 *      dislodged.
		 * (5) F Mid-Atlantic Ocean can convoy an army from or to Egypt 
                 *      or Hejaz. An army convoyed from Egypt or Hejaz attacks 
                 *      its destination space at full strength. An army 
                 *      convoyed to Egypt or Hejaz attacks at half strength.
		 * (6) If two units are retreating to Egypt or Hejaz, or the 
                 *      Mid-Atlantic Ocean, and one of them must travel around 
                 *      the southern tip of Africa, the unit that does not 
                 *      travel around southern Africa may retreat while the 
                 *      other unit is disbanded.
